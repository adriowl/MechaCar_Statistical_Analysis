Please see below for findings from the first experiment, where we performed multiple linear progression to observe the effect of multiple variables on MPG.
![VariablesEffectOnMPG](VariablesEffectOnMpg.png)
Two variables have an affect on MPG: 
- Vehicle_length
- Ground_clearance
These two independent variables are statistically significant due to their low p-values. They provided a low probability of random variance, meaning they are predictable in their effect on the dependent variable, MPG.

Our data does fit the line fairly well, as we can see from our R-squared or correlation coefficient: Around 0.7 means this model fits about 70 percent of our data. The p-value being extremely small also bodes well, as that signals that our findings are in some way statistically significant. More analysis needed to really dig into those two variables listed above.
